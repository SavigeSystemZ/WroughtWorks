## Active risks

- Risk: Validation baseline is still partially inferred or unproven
  Severity: Medium
  Area: validation / onboarding
  Why it matters: The repo-local confidence model still depends on confirming repo-local validation proof against real commands instead of inference alone.
  Mitigation: Run the smallest real repo-local validation lane, replace fallback lines in `TEST_STRATEGY.md`, and record exact passing evidence in `_system/context/CURRENT_STATUS.md`.
  Trigger to revisit: After the first successful repo-local validation run, when toolchain assumptions change, or before any release-readiness claim.
  Owner: current maintainer or active agent

- Risk: Generated delivery surfaces may not match the repo's real packaging and install needs yet
  Severity: Medium
  Area: packaging / install
  Why it matters: ops/, packaging/, mobile/, ai/ are present or inferred, but they still need repo-local review and proof before any distribution or deployment claim is trustworthy.
  Mitigation: Review generated runtime surfaces, confirm packaging targets and installer commands in `_system/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`, and run the first relevant build, install, or smoke proof.
  Trigger to revisit: Before packaging work, before distribution, or after changing deployment targets.
  Owner: current maintainer or active agent

- Risk: Security and compliance posture is not yet repo-specific
  Severity: High
  Area: security / compliance
  Why it matters: The operating system can point to baseline checks, but safety / compliance, security, secret handling, and related security fields are still unset or too generic for confident release or exposure decisions.
  Mitigation: Fill the security and compliance section in `_system/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`, confirm secret-handling and data-classification rules, and keep `bootstrap/scan-security.sh` in the real validation path.
  Trigger to revisit: Before using real secrets, before external exposure, before production-like data handling, or before release readiness.
  Owner: current maintainer or active agent

## Watch list

- Replace or remove these seeded first-pass risks once repo-local validation evidence and project-specific profile truth exist.
- Add or tighten operational risk entries as soon as ports, background services, deployment topology, or release policy become concrete.
- **Template drift:** Downstream app repos may fall behind AIAST upgrades if `bootstrap/update-template.sh` (or equivalent) is not run on a cadence. *Severity: low for sandbox repos; higher for production.* Mitigation: track AIAST version in `_system/.template-version` and refresh from master template when security or validation contracts change.

## Usage rules

- Keep this focused on real risk, not generic worry.
- Cross-link material unresolved issues from `FIXME.md`.
