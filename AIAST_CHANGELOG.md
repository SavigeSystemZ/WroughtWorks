# AIAST Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Feature — Grok CLI as a first-class agent:** added the xAI Grok CLI (`grok` command, repo-local `.grok/`) as a concurrent multi-agent participant. `agent-instance-policy.json` gains `grok` (naming regex, allowed types, `concurrency_caps grok=3`) so multiple `grok-NN` instances run under the standard lease/fencing model; `host-adapter-manifest.json` gains the `grok` generated adapter (`GROK.md`) and `.grok/` host settings; the managed-file inventory, classifier, both host-launch contracts, surface taxonomy, performance/context-budget profiles, discovery/enumeration surfaces, and the MOS meta-layer (`META_GROK.md`) were all updated. Generated KEY/registry/master-map/capabilities/integrity refreshed (managed-file inventory 849→852; adapters 11→12).
- **Feature — cross-repo boundary disclosure:** a prominent disclosure at the top of `AGENTS.md` instructs every agent to operate only the meta-system in the repo it was launched from — never the parent `_AI_AGENT_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE` copy or another app's `_system/` — with host-mandated dirs (`.gemini/`, `.claude/`, `.grok/`) as the sole exception. Cross-links the existing containment enforcement.
- **Feature — project-owned meta-system guide:** new `_system/PROJECT_OWNED_METASYSTEM_GUIDE.md` is the positive complement — it tells a `downstream-app` agent that its own meta-system copy is project-owned and improvable, with a three-bucket map (customize freely / extend additively via the self-improvement loop / leave template-managed) and the safe how-to. Reconciles the previously absolute-sounding "do not edit `_system/`" line in `APP_REPO_IDENTITY.md`. Wired into `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, and `READ_BUNDLES.md`.
- **Drift fix — adapter peer-reference normalization:** the nine inconsistent, hand-maintained "other primary adapter files exist for X, Y, Z…" enumerations across adapter notes were replaced with a single drift-proof pointer to `_system/AGENT_DISCOVERY_MATRIX.md`, eliminating the per-new-agent maintenance trap.
- **Bug fix — invalid JSON:** `_system/agent-performance-profiles.json` had been committed with a duplicated trailing block (invalid JSON that nothing strict-parsed). Repaired.
- **Bug fix — silent no-op generator:** `bootstrap/generate-super-template-master-map.sh` used a strictly positional target argument, so a `--write`-only invocation silently resolved the target to `"--write"` and regenerated nothing. It now accepts a leading flag with an implied repo-root target, matching the other generators.

## 1.25.0 (2026-06-02)

**Git tag:** `v1.25.0` (merged to `main` and tagged 2026-06-03).

- **Architecture — Lean-Hybrid validator accelerator:** the Evolution-Plan Go migration was audited and re-scoped. The over-reaching parts (a ~40 MB platform-specific binary committed to git and scaffolded into every downstream repo; an embedded NATS Swarm Event-Bus + Google GenAI/gRPC dependency surface; gutted bash-to-binary operational shims) were reversed. `aiast-cli` is now a small (~4 MB), **pure-stdlib, zero-dependency** validator accelerator built **on demand** by the tracked `bootstrap/aiast-cli` launcher / `bootstrap/build-aiast-cli.sh` into the gitignored `bootstrap/.bin/` — never a committed blob. The operational layer (init/scaffold/gitops/swarm/locks) stays in proven portable bash. The deferred swarm Go is parked (not deleted) under `src/aiast-cli/internal/_deferred/` (not compiled, now excluded from downstream scaffold).
- **Hardening — portable graceful-skip contract:** the `bootstrap/aiast-cli` launcher now degrades cleanly. On a machine with no Go toolchain and no prebuilt binary, the read-only `check-*` validator subcommands emit a structured `*_skipped reason=no-go-toolchain` and return neutral success, so `system-doctor` and the downstream gates still pass — making the documented "works without the binary / portable / just-works" promise true. Operational subcommands (`compact`/`doctor`/`validate`) are never skipped. Set `AIAST_REQUIRE_CLI=1` (the factory/CI master lane now does) to make the binary mandatory and turn the skip back into a hard failure, so maintainer/CI environments never silently skip validation. The nine validator shims were standardized to thin strict-mode entry points; `smoke-aiast-cli.sh` gained graceful-skip / strict-gate / operational-non-skip cases (`cases=11`).
- **Fix — restored Go validator correctness (audit follow-through):** `check_evidence_quality.go` no longer uses an RE2-illegal lookahead (was a hard panic); `permissions.go` and `boundary.go` honor the positional repo argument (were defaulting to cwd via a named `-repo` flag); `check-git-discipline.sh` remote detection no longer sends git output to `/dev/null` before the pipe (the origin check was dead). Cleared the shell-robustness regressions the migration introduced (strict-mode on the validator shims, plus genuine shellcheck findings in `validate-system.sh`, `compact-context.sh`, `check-context-isolation.sh`, `check-git-discipline.sh`).
- **Enhancement — Phase 1 Evolution Plan (Stabilization):** Implemented native Safe-Sync in `update-template.sh` (which creates an automatic `.update_backups/` snapshot instead of silently overwriting locally modified template files) and added `bootstrap/compact-context.sh` for automated context compaction and LLM token bloat reduction.
- **Fix — Heretic integration cleanup:** registered the Heretic wrapper as a discoverable plugin with `plugin.json` and `run.sh`, updated capability markers, and made the wrapper resolve `HERETIC_DIR`, the actual maintainer donor path `~/.MyAppZ/_HERETIC_META_SYSTEM_ENHANCMENTS/heretic-master`, and the corrected spelling fallback.
- **Fix — Antigravity host/MCP cleanup:** corrected Antigravity host-settings metadata to deep-merge project settings, documented the user-local `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` JSON requirement, regenerated `ANTIGRAVITY.md` from the manifest, and added Antigravity to host-launch policy-contract coverage.

## 1.24.0 (2026-05-23)

**Git tag:** pending `v1.24.0` after merge to `main`.

- **Enhancement — Downstream self-improvement + app-context finalization:** ships the downstream-local improvement loop (`propose-local-self-improvement.sh`, `apply-local-self-improvement.sh`, `check-local-self-improvement.sh`) and app-context authoring system (`generate-app-context-pack.sh`, `validate-app-context-files.sh`, universal placeholders, and archetype-routed context templates) as optional installable overlays. The self-writing boundary is policy-contracted, runtime artifacts stay under ignored project-local state, and parent-template mode refuses downstream-only mutation.
- **Hardening — fleet propagation close-out:** additive downstream propagation completed across 33 repos (`ok=33 fail=0`), the final meta-sync reconcile sweep completed (`ok=33 noop=0 blocked=0 fail=0`), aggregate meta-sync state ended pending 0 / stale 0 / blocked 0, and the fleet health dashboard ended green (`selected=33 green=33 yellow=0 red=0`, bleed events 0). PalmOracle and PharmPhreak downstream namespace/role drift were repaired as part of the proof sweep.
- **Fix — nested template snapshot scan false positive:** `check-network-bindings.sh` now skips top-level vendored `TEMPLATE/` and `MOS_TEMPLATE/` snapshots when validating an installed repo, while still scanning a real source-template root. This prevents installed app repos with nested template snapshots from failing on the checker scripts' own wildcard-detection literals.
- **Fix — large scaffold-profile validators:** `validate-scaffold-output.sh`, `check-scaffold-required-files.sh`, and `check-mos-downstream-exclusion.sh` now pass rendered scaffold-profile payloads to Python through temp files instead of argv. This keeps large repos with nested scaffolds from hitting OS argument-length limits during validation.
- **Fix — scaffold exclude matching for dotfiles:** `render-scaffold-profile.sh` and `validate-scaffold-output.sh` now strip only a literal leading `./` instead of all leading `.`/`/` characters, so `.env` remains excluded while `.env.example` stays allowed.
- **Hardening — updater self-refresh delivery:** `update-template.sh` re-execs from a stable source tempfile before any non-dry-run self-refresh, and the factory additive sweep invokes the canonical source updater. This prevents bash parser corruption when `bootstrap/update-template.sh` itself is always-refreshed.
- **Policy — simple GitHub mirror for single-developer repos:** GitHub policy now defines the remote as a private, full mirror of the local repo, with local `main` as the normal working branch and `origin/main` as the mirror target. Feature/fix/chore branch stacks, PR-required gates, Issues/Projects/Wiki, and GitHub-side authority are opt-in collaboration exceptions rather than the default. `gitops-policy.json` encodes `branch_strategy=main_only`, `gitops.sh mirror` provides a `gh`-backed repo-create/configure/push flow, and `aiast git ...` exposes the helper through the operator front door. The machine policy, GitHub policy docs, MCP GitHub scope docs, and helper entrypoints are now always-refresh managed so existing downstream repos receive the mirror model on the normal additive lane.
- **Validation proof (maintainer host, run as `whyte`):**
  - `bash _TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh` → `master_template_validation_ok`
  - `bash _TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-downstream-additive.sh` → `ok=33 fail=0`
  - fleet reconcile sweep → `ok=33 noop=0 blocked=0 fail=0`
  - `bash _TEMPLATE_FACTORY/aggregate-fleet-meta-sync-state.sh --quiet --json` → pending 0, stale 0, blocked 0
  - `bash _TEMPLATE_FACTORY/fleet-health-dashboard.sh --quiet` → `fleet_health_ok selected=33 green=33 yellow=0 red=0`

- **Hardening — S22d final polish (World-Class program close):** **WS1 chronic-yellow elimination:** `fleet-health-dashboard.sh` no longer conflates operator-territory git hygiene (branch/upstream/dirty) into system "yellow" — that mislabel had pinned the entire 31-repo fleet to a permanent, never-actioned yellow. Health now reflects system integrity only (red = isolation fail or high+ bleed; yellow = real always-refresh meta-managed drift; green = clean — git flags do NOT dock it); git hygiene is reported on a separate, explicitly non-blocking `operator_advisory` channel (envelope + markdown + `operator_advisory=<n>` in the quiet line). **WS11 operator ergonomics + recovery:** new `bootstrap/operator-hygiene-advisor.sh` — dry-run-by-default, only ever offers a safe subset (stale lock guard dirs past lease, stray `*.swp`/`*.orig`/`claude_diff.patch`), and is strictly report-only for anything tracked or git-historical (never rewrites history, force-pushes, or touches tracked files). New `aiast` verbs: `tidy` (the advisor) and `audit` (repo-local `system-doctor` diagnostic); `aiast doctor` already passes `--heal`/`--report` through. `rollback` intentionally NOT added — no safe backing mechanism exists and stubbing it would be fake functionality (tracked, deferred). New 4-case `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-disaster-recovery.sh` (tidy dry-run vs `--apply`; corruption→detect→`verify-integrity --generate` recovery drill; classifier unit-assert that git-flags⇒green+advisory). Wired into `validate-master-template.sh`; contracts re-synced; integrity signed & verified; net shellcheck debt unchanged (baseline 41).

- **Hardening — S22c elevation tier (World-Class program; the self-sustaining "100+" core):** **WS3 policy-contract subsystem:** generalized the S21 host-launch contract into a first-class, extensible mechanism. New `TEMPLATE/_system/policy-contracts/*.json` (managed, propagated): `host-launch.json` (migrated, 6 hosts), `mcp-isolation.json` (closes the S16 absolute-path-placeholder fleet-outage class), `instruction-precedence.json` (pins AGENTS.md as precedence #1). New generic engine `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/check-policy-contracts.sh` (json+toml+text; equals/superset/contains/regex_present/regex_absent; `--json` is value-only — SIGPIPE-safe per the aiast lesson) + `smoke-policy-contracts.sh` (6 cases: live, coverage, 3-way negative degradation matrix, born-in). **Born-in enforcement:** `check-metasystem-quality-gate.sh` now hard-fails (mandatory precondition, independent of the 0-100 score) if the policy-contracts subsystem is missing/empty or not lane-wired — a new safety surface without a contract can no longer ship silently. **WS9 meta-self-audit / World-Class Index:** new `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/meta-self-audit.sh` computes a single scored index (0-100) across 9 hardening dimensions (shell-robustness, smoke-registration, status-doc-hygiene, lib-modularity, policy-contracts, integrity-signed, lock-atomicity, quality-gate, fleet-posture) → dated `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/WORLD_CLASS_INDEX/<date>/{summary.json,dashboard.md}` + append-only `trend.jsonl`; any dimension regression drops the index visibly. 4-case smoke. Current index: **100/100**. **WS4 mutation testing (proves the gates bite):** new `mutation-catalogue.json` (8 known-bad mutations of safety surfaces) + `mutation-harness.sh` — applies each mutation to a sandboxed-then-restored surface, runs the gate that must catch it, asserts failure; computes kill-rate (SLO 100%). Rigorous per-mutation + EXIT-trap restore + post-run pristine check. Initial run surfaced (and the catalogue was corrected for) an unfair mutation landing in the archived doc zone — **kill-rate now 100% (8/8)**. All wired into `validate-master-template.sh` (`mutation-harness --fast`); contracts re-synced; integrity signed & verified; net shellcheck debt unchanged (baseline 41).

- **Hardening — S22b structural decomposition (World-Class program, careful tier):** **WS6 lib decomposition:** the 1146-line `bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh` monolith is split into 7 cohesive modules (`aiaast-core.sh` colors/asserts/time/require/sanitize, `aiaast-json.sh` envelopes, `aiaast-classify.sh` path classification, `aiaast-repo.sh` version/metadata/profile/mode, `aiaast-sync.sh` onboarding+meta-sync notices, `aiaast-managed.sh` managed-file engine, `aiaast-lock.sh` S22a lock primitives). `aiaast-lib.sh` is now a thin dependency-ordered loader sourcing modules relative to its own dir — **fully back-compatible**: same source path, identical 51-function contract, same signatures/behaviour (verified by exact `declare -F` diff). All 7 modules added to `always_refresh_files` and registered in SYSTEM_REGISTRY/INTEGRITY_MANIFEST. New `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/lint-lib-modularity.sh` (loader-list == present-modules, ≤400 lines/module, modules never source each other, composed-contract floor ≥51 functions). Net shellcheck debt unchanged (the 4 monolith findings relocated verbatim; baseline still 41). **WS10 signed integrity manifest:** closes the "manifest is self-attesting / trivially regenerable to mask tampering" gap. `verify-integrity.sh --generate` now also writes `_system/INTEGRITY_MANIFEST.sha256.sig` = HMAC-SHA256 of the manifest keyed by a per-repo seed at `_system/agent-state/integrity/seed` (auto-created `0600`; agent-state is already gitignored, never propagated, leak-guarded — a genuine local secret). `--check` verifies the signature after the content check; a manifest rewritten to match tampered files but not re-signed (no seed) is detected → hard fail (rc 3) + a `integrity-signature-mismatch` bleed-event (schema + `emit-bleed-event.sh` extended). Missing seed/sig degrades to a non-fatal "unsigned" advisory (back-compat for fresh/legacy downstreams until they regenerate). Seed and `.sig` are manifest-excluded so signing never perturbs the managed set. New 6-case `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-integrity-signing.sh` (incl. the realistic manifest-rewrite attack + bleed emission + back-compat + exclusion proofs). Both gates wired into `validate-master-template.sh`.

- **Hardening — S22a foundation wave (World-Class program, no-regret tier):** Four no-structural-change hardening workstreams. **WS2 atomic locking:** new `aiaast_lock_acquire`/`aiaast_lock_release`/`aiaast_lock_is_stale` primitives in `bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh` using an atomic `mkdir` guard directory (`<scope>.lock.d`) with lease-aware stale reclaim; the legacy `<scope>.lock.json` is still written so every existing reader (`check-agent-locks.sh`, `agent-unlock.sh`, `agent-reclaim-lock.sh`) is unchanged. `agent-lock.sh`/`agent-unlock.sh`/`agent-reclaim-lock.sh` rewritten onto the primitive — eliminates the check-then-create TOCTOU race fleet-wide (previously only `reconcile-meta-sync.sh` was atomic) and fixes a latent bug where an expired lease blocked acquisition forever. 8-case `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-atomic-lock.sh` incl. a 24-way parallel race proof (exactly one winner) and a leaked-lock-on-failed-write guard. **WS7 shell robustness gate:** new `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/lint-shell-robustness.sh` — hard zero-tolerance rule against same-statement `local x=$1 y=...$x` (the documented `set -u` footgun; the one real occurrence in `snapshotctl.sh` fixed) plus a shellcheck **ratchet** (`shellcheck-baseline.txt`, 41 accepted entries; new findings fail, resolved findings must be de-baselined so debt only shrinks); sourced libraries allowlisted via `shell-robustness-allowlist.txt`. **WS5 lane-gating discipline:** new `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/lint-smoke-registration.sh` fails if any `smoke-*.sh` is not wired into a canonical lane (master / factory-automation / MOS) — institutionalizes the lesson that the `aiast` SIGPIPE bug passed the standalone smoke but only failed under the full lane; CI merge-gate policy documented in `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/CI_MERGE_GATE_POLICY.md` (workflows already `pull_request`-triggered). **WS8 doc anti-accretion:** new `check-status-doc-hygiene.sh` (active zone ≤220 lines, no duplicate `## ` headers, no dangling deferrals) + `rotate-status-doc.sh`; `.ai/CURRENT_STATUS.md` reset from 929 lines/91 sections (with literal duplicate headers) to a 38-line active window, full prior content preserved verbatim in `.ai/CURRENT_STATUS_HISTORY.md`. All four gates wired into `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh`.

- **Enhancement — Host launch-policy contract (V2 §S21, binary-free closure of §S20 Item 9):** Item 9's intent ("boot each host; assert meta-policy keys are honored at runtime") is reframed from *needs live host binaries in CI* (untestable in this environment, flaky as an opportunistic live test) to *assert the launch-governing safety policy contract the binary would enforce* — a deterministic, stronger regression guard. New declarative `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/host-launch-policy-contract.json` is the explicit, reviewable source of truth for the safety policy each host's meta-managed `.aiaast.*` file MUST carry: Codex `[approval] default_mode=auto-suggest` + `require_approval_for ⊇ {shell.write, shell.exec.network, fs.delete, git.push, git.reset}`; Claude `permissions.deny ⊇` the 10-entry destructive set (rm -rf /, sudo, git push --force/-f, git reset --hard, git clean -fd, curl/wget | sh/bash); Windsurf `cascade.denyShellPatterns ⊇ {rm -rf /, sudo *, git push --force*, git reset --hard*}`; and the universal `integrity.verify_meta_sync_before_handoff` gate + `AGENTS.md` instruction anchor for codex/gemini/cursor/copilot/windsurf. This closes a real gap: `check-host-settings-baseline.sh` only validates marker fields (`managed_by`/`policy_doc`/`preserve_first_sibling`), so a regression that emptied Codex `require_approval_for` or eroded the Claude/Windsurf deny lists would pass every existing smoke yet silently disable fleet-wide guardrails. New 8-case acceptance smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-host-launch-policy.sh` (json+toml parse via `tomllib`, dotted-key resolution, equals/superset/contains assertions, contract-coverage enforcement so adding a host without a contract entry fails, and a 3-way negative degradation matrix proving Codex-approval / Claude-deny / meta-sync-gate erosions are each detected). Wired into `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh`. Cumulative TEMPLATE-side regression now spans **19 isolation harnesses**. Factory-side only (not a scaffolded/managed file) — no downstream propagation or contract sync required.

- **Enhancement — Unified `aiast` operator front-door (V2 §S20 Item 10):** New single CLI dispatcher `TEMPLATE/bootstrap/aiast` gives operators and downstream agents one discoverable entrypoint over the 157-script `bootstrap/` surface instead of memorizing individual script names. 19 curated intent-named verbs grouped by operator concern (Health & validation, Meta-sync, Host settings, Agent coordination, Lifecycle, Meta): `doctor`, `validate`, `env`, `status`, `meta-sync-gate`, `reconcile`, `update`, `host-settings`, `host-settings-check`, `orchestration`, `lock`, `unlock`, `heartbeat`, `install`, `scaffold`, `version`, plus builtins `help`/`list`/`all`. Resolves every target relative to its own directory so it behaves identically in the TEMPLATE source and every scaffolded downstream. Args after the verb pass straight through via `exec`; dispatched commands return the child's own exit code, builtins emit `aiast_cli_ok` / `aiast_cli_error` and unknown commands exit 2 with a did-you-mean hint. `aiast list --json` exposes a machine-readable manifest for downstream tooling; `aiast all` still exposes the full raw script surface for power users; `aiast status` gives a one-shot posture (template version + meta-sync gate + doctor). New reference doc `_system/AIAST_CLI.md`. Registered in `_system/SYSTEM_REGISTRY.json` + `_system/INTEGRITY_MANIFEST.sha256` via `sync-metasystem-contracts.sh`. 8-case acceptance smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-aiast-cli.sh` (help render, JSON manifest shape, registry-script integrity, version parity, unknown→rc2, dispatch passthrough, raw-surface + integrity contract, no-arg→help) wired into `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh`. Cumulative TEMPLATE-side regression now spans **18 isolation harnesses**.

- **Enhancement — Meta-sync handoff protocol (V2 §S19e):** Every TEMPLATE → downstream sync now drops a machine-readable marker so the next agent that opens a session in that downstream picks up the handoff cleanly. New policy doc `_system/META_SYNC_RECONCILE_PROTOCOL.md` covers the full lifecycle. New helper `aiaast_emit_meta_sync_pending` in `bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh` writes `_system/agent-state/meta-sync/PENDING.json` at the tail of every `update-template.sh` run with timestamp, emitter actor/host, template version before/after, changeset (missing_installed, drifted_refreshed, always_refresh_applied), and host-settings rollup. Parent-template refusal guard ensures TEMPLATE/ never gets a marker. New startup gate `bootstrap/check-pending-meta-sync.sh` (default informational rc=0, `--strict` rc=1 when pending) reports state with a JSON envelope. New reconciler `bootstrap/reconcile-meta-sync.sh` consumes PENDING.json and runs six checks (verify-integrity, check-host-settings-baseline, check-system-awareness, check-host-adapter-alignment, validate-instruction-layer, apply-host-settings), cross-references the changeset against `WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md` for project-context relevance, appends a handoff note, archives the marker to `history.jsonl` + `LATEST_RECONCILE.json`, and deletes `PENDING.json`. Blocked path (any check failed) preserves the marker for clean re-run. New canonical-startup "Meta-sync gate" section in `TEMPLATE/AGENTS.md`. Every host's `*.aiaast.*` settings file gains `integrity.verify_meta_sync_before_handoff: true` + gate/reconcile commands; Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` banner extended to surface pending state inline. `validate-system.sh` leak guard excludes `_system/agent-state/**`. `aiaast_print_managed_files` walker excludes `_system/agent-state/*` so runtime state does not pollute the registry. 8-case acceptance smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-meta-sync-reconcile.sh` covers fresh state, emit schema, gate default vs `--strict`, happy reconcile, integrity-fail blocked path, project-context relevance hit, idempotent noop, parent-template emit guard. Wired into `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh`. Fleet propagation: second-pass additive sweep landed 31/31; per-repo reconcile sweep: 32 ok / 0 blocked / 0 errors. Fleet-health-dashboard posture unchanged. Cumulative TEMPLATE-side regression now **104/104 across 15 isolation harnesses**.

- **Enhancement — Host-settings baseline complete (V2 §S19a + §S19b, all 6 primary hosts active):** Every primary AI host adapter (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, Cursor) now ships with a hybrid preserve-first + always-refresh meta-managed settings pair in the deployable TEMPLATE. New merge helper `bootstrap/apply-host-settings.sh` walks the manifest and applies per-host strategies: claude=native (no-op), codex=TOML deep-merge, copilot/gemini/windsurf/cursor=JSON deep-merge. Deep-merge semantics: new keys installed; list values append-only; scalar conflicts → preserve-first wins (recorded as `shadowed` in the envelope); refuses to run inside the parent TEMPLATE without `--allow-template`. Hand-tuned per-host content: instruction-file allowlists pointing each host at canonical startup files (AGENTS.md, INSTRUCTION_PRECEDENCE_CONTRACT, REPO_OPERATING_PROFILE, MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT, PROJECT_RULES, EXECUTION_PROTOCOL, MULTI_AGENT_COORDINATION, HALLUCINATION_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL, SYSTEM_AWARENESS_PROTOCOL, TOOL_MEMORY_ISOLATION_STAMP); MCP server pointers to `_system/MCP_CONFIG.md` + per-host example configs; tool-memory stamp helper + contract refs per `_system/TOOL_MEMORY_ISOLATION_STAMP.md`; integrity verify-before-handoff hints; env hints `AIAST_HOST_ADAPTER=<host>`. Codex baseline additionally pins `approval.default_mode = "auto-suggest"` with `require_approval_for = [shell.write, shell.exec.network, fs.delete, git.push, git.reset]`. Windsurf baseline adds `cascade.denyShellPatterns` mirroring the Claude deny list. Cursor baseline adds an indexing-exclude allowlist (`_system/history/**`, `_system/automation/*.log`, `_system/agent-state/**`, etc.) so the codebase index skips noise. `always_refresh_files` grew 16 → 20 with the 4 new `.aiaast.*` entries; S17a smoke auto-tracked. Linter (`bootstrap/check-host-settings-baseline.sh`) now reports `host_settings_baseline_ok active=6 passing=6 planned=0`. Cumulative TEMPLATE-side regression unchanged at 96/96 across 14 harnesses; the host-settings smoke continues 7/7.

- **Enhancement — Host-settings baseline (V2 §S19a, Claude Code + GitHub Copilot reference impls):** First-class agent-host configuration ships in the deployable template. **Claude Code:** `TEMPLATE/.claude/settings.json` (preserve-first, app-owned) and `TEMPLATE/.claude/settings.aiaast.json` (always-refresh, meta-managed with `$aiaast` marker block) deliver fleet-wide permissions allowlist, deny list for destructive operations, `Stop` hook running `bootstrap/verify-integrity.sh --check`, and `UserPromptSubmit` banner emitting template-version + integrity status. **GitHub Copilot:** `TEMPLATE/.github/copilot-config.json` (preserve-first) and `TEMPLATE/.github/copilot-config.aiaast.json` (always-refresh, marker-protected) carry the instruction-file allowlist (chat, code-generation, commit-message, review), MCP server pointer (`_system/MCP_CONFIG.md`), tool-memory stamp helper + contract refs, and an integrity-verify-before-handoff hint. Copilot's rules surface (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) remains under the S12 adapter surface flow. Single source of truth in `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json` → new top-level `host_settings` block (claude + copilot active; codex/gemini/windsurf/cursor planned for S19b). New policy doc `_system/HOST_SETTINGS_BASELINE.md` covers hybrid split semantics, per-host merge matrix, integrity wiring, and operator workflow. New linter `bootstrap/check-host-settings-baseline.sh` walks the manifest, validates each active adapter's preserve-first + meta-managed files exist + parse + carry the marker (failure codes `file_missing`, `parse_error`, `marker_missing`, `marker_managed_by_wrong`, `marker_fields_missing`); 7-case acceptance smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-host-settings-baseline.sh`. `aiaast_print_managed_files` now sweeps `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.windsurf/`; `aiaast_path_category` emits new categories `host-settings-meta`, `host-settings-app`, `host-overlay`. `_system/HOST_SETTINGS_BASELINE.md`, `.claude/settings.aiaast.json`, and `.github/copilot-config.aiaast.json` enrolled in `always_refresh_files` (now 16 entries, auto-protected by S17a). Validator chain wired: `check-host-settings-baseline` + `smoke-host-settings-baseline` added to `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh`.

- **Enhancement — Isolation finalization wave V2 §S11–§S18 (per-host stamping → fleet health dashboard):** Closes the AIAST V2 isolation roadmap from the writer-side adapter primitive through to a unified operator dashboard, with full fleet rollout to 31 downstream repos.
  - **S11 — Writer-side tool-memory stamp helper.** `TEMPLATE/bootstrap/stamp-tool-memory.sh` prepends or augments the per-host isolation stamp before adapters append non-trivial content. Idempotent on same `(adapter, agent_id)`; augments into `agents:` list when a second agent writes; refuses parent-template repos, app_id mismatch, invalid agent_id, or files resolving outside `_system/tool-memory/`. 9-case smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-stamp-tool-memory.sh`.
  - **S12 — Adapter surface parity for the stamp protocol.** Every canonical adapter surface (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, GEMINI.md, WINDSURF.md, CURSOR.md, COPILOT.md, AIDER.md, AGENT_ZERO.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md) now references both the stamp helper and `_system/TOOL_MEMORY_ISOLATION_STAMP.md`. Primary-surface bullets are added to `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json` so scaffolds inherit them via `generate-host-adapters.sh`. New linter `bootstrap/check-adapter-surface-stamps-protocol.sh` + 7-case smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-adapter-surface-stamps-protocol.sh`.
  - **S13 — Fleet rollout.** Applied preserve-first additive sweep to all 31 downstream repos. 124 placeholder files (4 × 31) auto-fixed. Per-repo memos under `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/evidence/fleet-rollout-s11-s12-2026-05-13/per-repo-memos/<RepoName>.md` document branch/upstream/remote state plus exact AGENTS.md remediation snippets.
  - **S14a — Fleet isolation migrator** (`_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/migrate-downstream-isolation.sh`, V2 §21.3). Survey-mode walks every downstream and runs the 6-check isolation suite per repo with structured evidence under `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/FLEET_ISOLATION_MIGRATION_<date>/<repo>/`. Apply-additive mode threads through `run-downstream-additive.sh`. Selectors: `--repos`, `--start/--batch`, `--refuse-dirty`. 5-case smoke.
  - **S15 — Library + updater promoted to always-refresh.** `bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh` and `bootstrap/update-template.sh` added to the `always_refresh_files` list in `TEMPLATE/bootstrap/update-template.sh`. Closes a fleet-wide outage where every downstream's `check-mcp-project-isolation.sh --json` failed with `aiaast_json_error: command not found` because the lib was 127 lines shorter than TEMPLATE. Seed pass refreshed all 31 repos from 826 → 953 lib lines.
  - **S16a — MCP example configs promoted to always-refresh.** `_system/MCP_CONFIG.md`, `_system/mcp/servers.cursor.example.json`, `_system/mcp/servers.codex.example.toml` now in `always_refresh_files`. Fleet sweep replaced absolute-path placeholders (`/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT`) with the modern `__AIAST_PROJECT_ROOT__` convention everywhere.
  - **S16b — Additive AGENTS.md `## Tool-memory writes`.** Appended the canonical section to every downstream's AGENTS.md without disturbing prior content. Adapter parity now 12/12 fleet-wide.
  - **S17a — Negative-test smoke for always-refresh** (`_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-always-refresh.sh`). 5 cases: C1 every entry exists in TEMPLATE, C2 scaffold populates each, C3 mutate-then-vanilla-refresh restores byte-for-byte, C4 preserve-first control on AGENTS.md still holds, C5 required infrastructure entries present (regression guard against accidental list shrinkage). Auto-parses the array out of `update-template.sh` so growth is automatically tracked. 13 entries protected today.
  - **S17b — Fleet bleed-event telemetry** (V2 §11/§12). `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/aggregate-fleet-bleed-events.sh` harvests `_system/agent-state/audit/*.jsonl` across every downstream and produces a rollup grouped by severity/type/repo/detector. Selectors: `--since`, `--severity` (exact or X+), `--type`, `--repo`, `--limit`. Output under `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/FLEET_BLEED_EVENTS_<date>/`. 7-case smoke. Initial fleet baseline: 0 events (no validators have emitted yet); tool stands ready.
  - **S18 — Unified fleet health dashboard.** `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/fleet-health-dashboard.sh` combines isolation status + bleed-event telemetry + git hygiene + always-refresh version drift into one read-only artifact. Per-repo classifier: **red** (isolation failure OR high+ bleed), **yellow** (green isolation but drift or git flags), **green** (all clean). Output: `dashboard.json` (machine) + `dashboard.md` (operator table) under `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/FLEET_HEALTH_<date>/`. 6-case smoke. Current snapshot: 31 selected, 0 red, 31 yellow (git hygiene only), 0 green.
  - **Validation proof at HEAD:**
    - `bash TEMPLATE/bootstrap/validate-system.sh TEMPLATE --strict` → `system_ok`
    - `bash TEMPLATE/bootstrap/system-doctor.sh TEMPLATE` → `system_doctor_ok`
    - `bash TEMPLATE/bootstrap/verify-integrity.sh --check --target TEMPLATE` → Integrity check passed
    - `bash _TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh` → `master_template_validation_ok` (12 isolation harnesses, 89/89 cumulative)
    - `bash _MOS_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-automation-lane.sh` → `mos_template_validation_ok`
    - `bash _TEMPLATE_FACTORY/migrate-downstream-isolation.sh --survey --quiet` → `fleet_isolation_migration_ok passed=31 refused=0`
    - `bash _TEMPLATE_FACTORY/fleet-health-dashboard.sh --quiet` → `fleet_health_ok selected=31 green=0 yellow=31 red=0`

- **Enhancement — Post-v3 productionization (P1–P4):** matrix benchmark realism, quality policy `1.1.0`, release packet `3.0.0`, and schema-backed payload validation. New schemas under `_system/schemas/`: `benchmark-matrix-report.schema.json`, `release-packet.schema.json`, `release-packet-artifacts.schema.json`. New installable tools: `bootstrap/run-test-app-benchmark-matrix.sh --execute` (isolated per-cell scaffold + scoping flags `--profiles/--archetypes/--limit-cells`), `bootstrap/summarize-benchmark-trend.sh`, `bootstrap/validate-benchmark-report.sh`, `bootstrap/validate-release-packet.sh`. Factory smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-benchmark-trend.sh` (pass + corrupted-report fail assertion) wired into the master-template lane. `bootstrap/generate-release-packet.sh` now emits deterministic sorted artifact index + checksum manifest + checksum-backed signature metadata. `bootstrap/emit-archetype-pack.sh` refreshes registry and integrity after write-mode `ACTIVE_ARCHETYPE.txt` changes.
- **Enhancement — Hybrid Git + Snapshot Operating System:** installable contracts (`_system/HYBRID_APP_REPO_LAYOUT_CONTRACT.md`, `_system/SINGLE_FOUNDER_GIT_OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`, `_system/SNAPSHOT_VERSIONING_AND_RETENTION_SPEC.md`, `_system/OBSERVABILITY_AND_RECOVERY_LEDGER_PROTOCOL.md`) plus automation (`bootstrap/gitops.sh`, `bootstrap/snapshotctl.sh`, `bootstrap/generate-ops-notes.sh`, `bootstrap/hybrid-git-sync.sh`). `snapshotctl.sh` publish/`--target` resolution and zstd long-window decoding (`--long=31`) now policy-aligned. `LOAD_ORDER.md`, `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, and `bootstrap/README.md` cross-link the new surfaces.
- **Enhancement — Ultra Super-Template Expansion v2 (Waves A–D) + v2.1 hardening:** super-map productionization, scaffold-profile and archetype-pack authoring standards plus validators, app delivery autopilot, safe permission/setup repair, validation discovery/autopilot, workspace service registry, fleet control tower, quality/status engine, global app report sink, external-agent-surface harvest, and test-app benchmark campaign protocols. v2.1 normalized JSON envelopes across new Ultra scripts and added deterministic schema artifacts under `_system/quality-gates/`; smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-ultra-expansion-v2.sh` upgraded with failure-mode assertions.
- **Enhancement — Wave 5 governance UX:** canonical JSON envelope + metadata helpers in `bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh`; governance checkers normalized for `--json` and consistent exit semantics; aggregate governance lane reporting via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/generate-governance-lane-report.sh`; downstream rollout drill modes `plan|apply-simulated|rollback-simulated` in `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/rehearse-wave3-downstream-rollout.sh`. New protocol doc `_system/DOWNSTREAM_APPLY_ROLLBACK_DRILL_PROTOCOL.md`.
- **Enhancement — Factory lane preflights and quiet-warning governance:** `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/check-whyte-lane-ownership.sh` (fail-fast preflight wired into automation + maintainer lanes), operator-invoked `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/repair-whyte-lane-ownership.sh --dry-run`, adapter-completeness gate `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/check-adapter-completeness.sh` with isolated smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-adapter-completeness.sh` (pass + drift fail assertion), `--quiet-warnings` mode for automation and maintainer lanes plus the master-template validator (`AIAST_QUIET_WARNINGS=1`) with safety smoke `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-quiet-warnings.sh` proving suppression is benign-only. Runtime uninstall (`bootstrap/templates/runtime/ops/install/uninstall.sh`) gates `systemctl --user` calls on session availability.
- **Enhancement — Schema-mapped script result validation + meta dashboard:** `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-script-json-envelopes.sh` enforces script result schemas; meta-system health dashboard generator and report wired into the lane. JSON envelope/governance schemas tightened across Wave 2/3/4/5 surfaces.
- **Fix — Per-session temp files** in `bootstrap/run-validation-autopilot.sh` and `bootstrap/check-fleet-readiness.sh` to remove temp-file collision regressions in concurrent lane runs.
- **Fix — Adapter coverage in managed-file registry:** `bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh` `aiaast_print_managed_files` and `aiaast_path_category` now include the adapter parity placeholders (`CURSOR.md`, `COPILOT.md`, `AIDER.md`, `AGENT_ZERO.md`) so they flow through `SYSTEM_REGISTRY.json`, `KEY.md`, and `INTEGRITY_MANIFEST.sha256`.

- **Enhancement — App-builder meta-system tranche A-D:** added and integrated four new installable contracts:
  - `_system/APP_BUILDER_META_SYSTEM_ORCHESTRATION.md`
  - `_system/APP_BUILDER_DOMAIN_ADAPTATION_RAILS.md`
  - `_system/APP_BUILDER_SECURITY_AND_AUTO_CORRECTION_CONTRACT.md`
  - `_system/APP_BUILDER_RELEASE_READINESS_STANDARD.md`
  These are wired into `_system/CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, `_system/LOAD_ORDER.md`,
  `_system/PROMPTS_INDEX.md`, and prompt pack
  `_system/prompt-packs/M17_APP_BUILDER_META_SYSTEM_EXECUTION.md` so
  app-builder execution is deterministic, domain-adaptive, containment-aware,
  bounded for auto-correction, and release-gated.
- **Validation proof (maintainer host, run as `whyte`):**
  - `bash TEMPLATE/bootstrap/validate-instruction-layer.sh TEMPLATE` -> pass
  - `bash TEMPLATE/bootstrap/check-system-awareness.sh TEMPLATE` -> pass
  - `bash TEMPLATE/bootstrap/system-doctor.sh TEMPLATE` -> pass
  - `bash TEMPLATE/bootstrap/validate-system.sh TEMPLATE --strict` -> pass
  - `bash _TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-automation-lane.sh` -> `automation_lane_ok`
  - `bash _MOS_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-automation-lane.sh` -> `mos_template_validation_ok`

- **Enhancement — Downstream preservation + sync notice:** added `_system/DOWNSTREAM_PRESERVATION_AND_SYNC_NOTICE_POLICY.md` (master template vs app repo, preserve-first recap, agent health gate), `_system/TEMPLATE_SYNC_NOTICE.md` baseline, `bootstrap/clear-template-sync-notice.sh`, and `aiaast_emit_template_sync_notice` in `bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh`. Successful non-dry-run `init-project.sh`, `install-missing-files.sh`, and `update-template.sh` runs now write `_system/TEMPLATE_SYNC_NOTICE.md` with **PENDING_HEALTH_CHECK** and append `_system/history/template-sync-events.jsonl`. `LOAD_ORDER.md`, `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, `UPGRADE_AND_DRIFT_POLICY.md`, `TEMPLATE_CHANGE_IMPACT_POLICY.md`, and `AGENT_INIT_CONVERGENCE.md` cross-link the policy. Maintainer boundary doc: `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/DOWNSTREAM_ROLLOUT_PRESERVATION_AND_MASTER_REPO_BOUNDARY.md`.
- **Fix — Template sync history vs managed-file registry:** `_system/history/template-sync-events.jsonl` is classified as stateful/runtime-only, and `_system/history/*` is omitted from `aiaast_print_managed_files` so `check-system-awareness` does not report “Managed file missing from registry” on the same `init-project` run that creates the JSONL append-only log (before a later registry refresh).
- **Fix — Template sync notice vs integrity / doctor:** `_system/TEMPLATE_SYNC_NOTICE.md` is treated as local volatile state for integrity manifest purposes (bootstrap rewrites it after install/update), so `verify-integrity` no longer false-fails on fresh downstream repos. **`system-doctor.sh`:** corrected `check-swarm-fleet` control flow so a failed swarm check sets `failed=1` without being masked by the `|| failed=1` idiom inside the `if` condition.

- **Enhancement — Preserve-first agent-surface migration:** `migrate-agent-surface-upgrade.sh --write` runs `install-missing-files.sh --skip-onboarding-seeds`, and `aiaast_refresh_onboarding_baseline` honors `AIAST_SKIP_ONBOARDING_SEEDS=1` by skipping suggest/seed passes so `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`, working files, and `_system/context` bullets are not bulk-rewritten during additive file installs. Operators can pass `--skip-onboarding-seeds` on any `install-missing-files.sh` invocation for the same effect. Documented in `_system/AGENT_INIT_CONVERGENCE.md` and `bootstrap/update-template.sh` usage text for `--refresh-managed` snapshot expectations.

- **Enhancement — Contract sync command:** added
  `bootstrap/sync-metasystem-contracts.sh` to run adapter generation, system registry/profile regeneration, integrity generation, and core validation checks in one deterministic flow.
- **Enhancement — Downstream migration assistant:** added
  `bootstrap/migrate-agent-surface-upgrade.sh` with `--dry-run` and `--write`
  modes to roll out dual-metasystem agent-surface upgrades to existing
  downstream repos.
- **Enhancement — Parity and quality gates:** added
  `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/check-aiast-mos-parity.sh` and
  `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/check-metasystem-quality-gate.sh`; both are now integrated
  into `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh`.
- **Enhancement — Adapter alias lifecycle enforcement:** extended
  `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json` `deprecated_aliases` entries with
  `target`, `deprecated_since`, `remove_after`, and `migration_doc`, and
  updated validators to fail on expired alias windows.
- **Enhancement — Dual metasystem unification:** added installable adapter governance and convergence contracts:
  - `_system/AGENT_SURFACE_TAXONOMY.md`
  - `_system/AGENT_INIT_CONVERGENCE.md`
  - `_system/OPERATOR_PROMPTING_PLAYBOOK.md`
- **Enhancement — Adapter parity placeholders:** added `CURSOR.md`, `COPILOT.md`, `AIDER.md`, and `AGENT_ZERO.md` as thin compatibility pointer files for scaffold comparability across mixed agent ecosystems.
- **Enhancement — Validation lane hardening:** added `bootstrap/check-agent-surface-integrity.sh`, integrated it into `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh`, and extended host-adapter alignment checks to enforce required placeholder presence and taxonomy/convergence references.
- **Enhancement — Meta-of-meta governance:** added `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/META_GOVERNANCE_FRAMEWORK.md` for proposal lifecycle, compatibility tiers, and evidence-backed release gates.
- **Enhancement — MOS parity crosswalk:** added `MOS_TEMPLATE/meta_system/META_AGENT_SURFACE_CROSSWALK.md` and wired MOS host-adapter policy/load/context docs to the crosswalk.

- **Fix — `bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh`:** `aiaast_refresh_onboarding_baseline`
  no longer propagates its `force` parameter to
  `generate-runtime-foundations.sh`. Runtime foundation templates under
  `bootstrap/templates/runtime/` are product-owned seeds (e.g.
  `ops/install/install.sh`, `ops/install/lib/runtime-foundation.sh`,
  `ops/compose/compose.yml`, `ops/env/.env.example`,
  `ops/install/lib/port_allocator.py`) that are copied into a downstream
  on first install and then customized by the app. Before this fix,
  `update-template.sh --refresh-managed` passed `REFRESH_MANAGED=1` as
  `force` all the way down to `generate-runtime-foundations.sh --force`,
  which silently overwrote the downstream's product-customized runtime
  seeds with the template's generic stubs. This was discovered during the
  first `1.23.0` replay to a production-scale repo, where ~989 lines of M1
  host-install work in `runtime-foundation.sh` were erased; the product
  content was restored from the pre-refresh commit. See maintainer proof
  evidence for the forensic trail. **This fix is committed on source `main`
  but is not yet published under a tag; the next release (whether `1.23.1` or
  whichever label a maintainer chooses) should ship it.**

## 1.23.0 (2026-04-14)

**Git tag:** `v1.23.0` (annotated tag on the AIAST source repository `main` branch).

### Cross-agent checkpointing capability

- **`bootstrap/write-checkpoint.sh`:** new agent-neutral writer of mid-session
  resume checkpoints. Any agent (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Windsurf,
  DeepSeek, Cline, Continue, Aider, PearAI, local models, or a human) can
  persist the current phase, completed steps, in-progress step, ordered next
  actions, blockers, resume files, resume command, and validation state into
  `_system/checkpoints/LATEST.json` + `LATEST.md` with an append-only history
  under `_system/checkpoints/history/`. Writes are atomic (tempfile + rename).
  Supports five checkpoint kinds: `session-start`, `mid-task`, `handoff`,
  `rate-limit-save`, `milestone`. Accepts `--from-json` for pre-built payloads
  with flag overrides layered on top. Zero new runtime dependencies beyond
  the `bash` + `python3` already required by the rest of the bootstrap layer.
- **`bootstrap/resume-from-checkpoint.sh`:** new concise resume-briefing reader.
  Emits a plain-text human briefing by default, JSON or Markdown on request,
  and can list every historical checkpoint. Exit codes distinguish "no
  checkpoint" (`3`) from "malformed checkpoint" (`4`) so scripts can branch
  cleanly.
- **`_system/CHECKPOINT_PROTOCOL.md`:** fully rewritten for mid-session
  semantics (not only session-end). Documents the five checkpoint kinds,
  required fields, writing and reading examples, file layout, rules
  (no secrets, honest validation, specific resume files), and the
  relationship between checkpoints, `WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md`, and
  `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`.
- **`_system/checkpoints/README.md`:** seed doc describing the checkpoint
  directory layout and the rules for every downstream install.
- **Startup wiring:** `_system/CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, `_system/LOAD_ORDER.md`,
  `_system/MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`, and `_system/SYSTEM_AWARENESS_PROTOCOL.md`
  now instruct every agent to run `bootstrap/resume-from-checkpoint.sh` on
  cold start, to write a checkpoint before stopping for any reason, and to
  persist `rate-limit-save` checkpoints before any command that could
  exhaust the remaining token/time budget.
- **`aiaast-capabilities.json`:** new `cross_agent_checkpointing` capability
  flag and `checkpoint_protocol` / `checkpoint_writer` / `checkpoint_reader` /
  `checkpoints_directory` markers.

### Downstream self-healing for `bootstrap/update-template.sh`

- **`bootstrap/update-template.sh`:** added a re-exec guard that detects drift
  between the installed copy of the script and the source template copy.
  When `--refresh-managed` is active and the two differ, the script copies
  the source version to a tempfile and re-execs from there before touching
  any managed files, preventing the bash parser corruption that previously
  occurred when the refresh loop rewrote the currently-executing script.
  Guarded by `AIAST_UPDATE_REEXEC` to prevent infinite re-exec loops, with
  an `EXIT` trap that cleans up the tempfile. Downstreams running pre-fix
  installed copies should run the **source** template's script directly
  once to clear the hazard; subsequent updates use the installed copy
  with the guard in place.

### Release process

- **Version markers:** `_system/.template-version`, `_system/.template-install.json`,
  `_system/aiaast-capabilities.json`, and `AIAST_VERSION.md` all bumped to
  `1.23.0` — minor bump because the checkpointing surfaces and scripts are
  net-new additive capability.
- **Validation:** `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-maintainer-lane.sh` →
  `maintainer_lane_ok`, `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-automation-lane.sh` →
  `automation_lane_ok`, `bootstrap/system-doctor.sh TEMPLATE --strict` → all
  16 checks green, `bootstrap/check-system-awareness.sh TEMPLATE` →
  `system_awareness_ok`.

## 1.22.1 (2026-04-12)

**Git tag:** `v1.22.1` (annotated tag on the AIAST source repository `main` branch).

### Downstream sync and integrity corrections

- **`bootstrap/update-template.sh`:** now repairs managed-file mode drift even
  when downstream file contents already match the source template, so `+x`
  bootstrap surfaces recover during refresh instead of staying silently wrong.
- **`bootstrap/lib/aiaast-lib.sh`:** integrity manifests now enumerate the
  managed installable surface instead of raw `find` output, eliminating
  transient runtime and bytecode noise from the canonical manifest while adding
  managed roots such as `distribution/`, `docs/`, `notes/`, `.credits-hidden`,
  `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE`.

### Proof-backed release closure

- **`CandleCompass` downstream proof:** the first `1.22.0` replay exposed an
  installed-doc boundary leak around absolute maintainer source-clone paths;
  after sanitizing those docs and replaying the fixed source template, strict
  validation and `system-doctor.sh` both passed.
- **`DOWNSTREAM_PROOF_PLAYBOOK.md`:** now documents the forbidden
  absolute-master-template-path failure mode and the required neutralized
  wording for installed continuity docs.

### Version alignment

- Patch release so installable **semver** (`AIAST_VERSION.md`,
  `_system/.template-version`, JSON markers, and plugin manifests
  `aiast_min_version`) matches the proof-backed source tag **`v1.22.1`**.

## 1.22.0 (2026-04-12)

### Governance hardening

- **`READ_BUNDLES.md`:** task-scoped bundle entrypoints so agents can load the smallest useful AIAST context instead of defaulting to the full load order.
- **`TEMPLATE_CHANGE_IMPACT_POLICY.md`:** high-risk template change classes and required follow-through for precedence, host emission, repair, install, update, and validation surfaces.
- **`SELF_HEALING_BOUNDARY.md`:** explicit separation between safe automatic repair and unsafe repair that requires review.
- **`VERSION_SENSITIVE_RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md`:** installable research-discipline contract for frameworks, packages, installers, platforms, APIs, and host tools that may change over time.

### Maintainer promotion discipline

- **Maintainer-only learning loop and promotion doctrine:** the master-repo meta workspace now governs how strong downstream patterns can be harvested back into AIAST without leaking app-specific truth.
- **Maintainer-only enhancement review packet:** preservation ledger, donor review, and AIAST-vs-SACST import map grounded in the full local repo audit plus the donor read of `/home/whyte/.MyAdminZ/_SYS_AGENT_CORE_TEMPLATE`.
- **`_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/check-template-impact.sh`** and **`check-promotion-readiness.sh`:** new factory checks for change-impact classification, follow-through requirements, donor provenance, and promotion gating.

### Validation and generated-surface alignment

- **`INSTRUCTION_PRECEDENCE_CONTRACT.md`**, **`instruction-precedence.json`**, **`PROMPT_EMISSION_CONTRACT.md`**, **`HOST_BUNDLE_CONTRACT.md`**, **`LOAD_ORDER.md`**, and **`REPO_OPERATING_PROFILE.*`:** aligned around bundle-aware loading, exact consistency surfaces, and stricter governance cross-references.
- **Validators and generators:** `detect-instruction-conflicts.sh`, `validate-instruction-layer.sh`, `check-system-awareness.sh`, `generate-operating-profile.sh`, and `system-doctor.sh` now recognize the new governance surfaces directly.
- **Generated artifacts:** host adapters, `_system/KEY.md`, `_system/SYSTEM_REGISTRY.json`, `_system/repo-operating-profile.json`, and `_system/INTEGRITY_MANIFEST.sha256` regenerated for the 1.22.0 surface.
- **Proof:** `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-maintainer-lane.sh` and `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-automation-lane.sh` passed on 2026-04-12, including strict source validation, installed-repo smoke, update-template smoke, blueprint, host-bundle, packaging, runtime-foundation, campaign, and live-host proofs.

## 1.21.1 (2026-04-06)

### Context efficiency

- **Input prose compression (opt-in):** `bootstrap/compress-context-file.sh`, `/compress-context`, `compress-context-input` skill, `CONTEXT_BUDGET_STRATEGY.md` subsection (mechanics + invocation), factory-vendored `caveman-compress` under `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/third_party/`. Tiered loading remains primary; only `docs/` and `notes/` prose paths are allowlisted.
- **`docs/README.md`**, **`notes/README.md`**, and **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** — symmetry for optional longform trees; FAQ for “compress-context-file refuses my path”.

### Documentation

- **`UPGRADE_AND_DRIFT_POLICY.md`:** **Pinning the source template (release tags)** — use `git fetch origin --tags` and checkout an annotated tag (for example `v1.21.0` or `v1.21.1`) in the master clone before passing `TEMPLATE/` to `bootstrap/update-template.sh --source` for reproducible drift checks.
- **`GIT_REMOTE_AND_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md`:** **Release tags** section — cross-links upgrade policy and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` / `AIAST_CHANGELOG.md`.

### Version alignment

- Patch release so installable **semver** (`AIAST_VERSION.md`, `.template-version`, JSON markers) matches the **documented** git-tag workflow; tag **`v1.21.1`** on the source repo marks this tree.

## 1.21.0 (2026-04-06)

**Git tag:** `v1.21.0` (annotated tag on the AIAST source repository `main` branch).

### GitHub merge discipline

- **`.github/pull_request_template.md`** — PR checklist (validation, secrets, AIAST contracts, hooks).
- **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`** — `config.yml`, `bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md` for consistent triage.
- **`HOOK_AND_ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md`** — extended with PR/issue template row; `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` links to `.github/` templates.

### Platform expansion (M16) and installable contracts

- **`M16_PLATFORM_PRODUCT_EXPANSION.md`** — bounded multi-surface expansion and hardening; **`PROMPTS_INDEX.md`** lists M15/M16.
- **Neutral app-fill placeholders:** `DELIVERY_GATES.md`, `AI_RULES.md`, `REPO_CONVENTIONS.md`, `SECURITY_BASELINE.md`.
- **`REQUEST_ALIGNMENT_PROTOCOL.md`** — risk-aware clarification; wired into `MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` and discovery docs.

### Autonomous guardrails and scheduling

- **`bootstrap/run-autonomous-guardrails.sh`**, **`bootstrap/install-autonomous-guardrails.sh`** — recurring checks; installer **`--dry-run`**; cron fallback uses valid multi-hour patterns when the minute field cannot express the interval.
- **`_system/automation/.gitignore`**, **`AUTONOMOUS_GUARDRAILS_PROTOCOL.md`** — runtime log hygiene and operator workflow.

### Delivery-gate alignment and troubleshooting

- **`bootstrap/check-delivery-gate-alignment.sh`** — enforced via **`validate-system.sh`** and **`system-doctor.sh`** so contracts stay discoverable in `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, `LOAD_ORDER.md`, and `MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`.
- **`VALIDATION_GATES.md`** — impact mapping when editing gates or contracts; **`DELIVERY_GATES.md`** — automated wiring section; **`AUTONOMOUS_GUARDRAILS_PROTOCOL.md`** — quick-mode note; **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** — remediation for alignment failures.

### Documentation (carried forward from pre-release)

- **`HOOK_AND_ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md`** — map of build-out hooks (Cursor rules/commands/skills/agents, plugins, validation doctors, GitHub/CI, MCP) and required companion files. **GitHub / CI steward** role in `AGENT_ROLE_CATALOG.md`; `.cursor/agents/github-ops.md`, `.cursor/commands/github-session.md`; Copilot and `AGENTS.md` cross-links; `MULTI_AGENT_COORDINATION.md` and `AGENT_DISCOVERY_MATRIX.md` updates.
- **`AGENT_INSTALLER_AND_HOST_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md`** — binding agent rules: scaffold installers early after first launchable build; production-like host testing (desktop integration where applicable); robust install/repair/uninstall; governed secure ports and DB/dependency setup; re-verify launch/render after large workloads. Wired into `AGENTS.md`, `MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`, `LOAD_ORDER.md`, `VALIDATION_GATES.md`, `EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`, `ports/PORT_POLICY.md`, `CROSS_PLATFORM_DISTRIBUTION_AND_INSTALLER_STANDARD.md`, `M6_INSTALL_AND_DISTRIBUTION.md`, and `CONTEXT_INDEX.md`.
- `bootstrap/templates/runtime/ops/compose/compose.yml` — comment reminding operators to assign a **unique** `APP_PORT` per repo when running multiple stacks on one machine (see `_system/ports/PORT_POLICY.md`).

### Working files

- Refreshed `PLAN.md`, `FIXME.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md`, `TEST_STRATEGY.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `_system/context/CURRENT_STATUS.md`, `_system/context/DECISIONS.md` (baseline content + 2026-04-06 review) to support `check-working-file-staleness.sh` and clearer downstream defaults.

### Maintainer (master repo only)

- Root `.github/pull_request_template.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` for AIAST layer-specific PR/issue discipline.

## 1.20.0 (2026-04-05)

### Plugin Contract V2 & Agent-Capability Matching

- **Plugin Contract V2:** Formalized richer `capabilities` and new lifecycle hooks (`bootstrap.pre_flight`, `validation.report`).
- **Capability Discovery:** Enhanced `discover-plugins.sh` to automatically generate `_system/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.json`.
- **Agent Matchmaking:** Updated `AGENT_ROLE_CATALOG.md` to map agent roles (e.g., `fleet_secops`) to native plugin capabilities.
- **Diagnostic Visibility:** Integrated capability matrix display into `system-doctor.sh`.
- **Core Plugins:** Updated `security-scan`, `ci-integration`, and `observability-setup` to align with the V2 contract.

## 1.19.7 (2026-04-05)

### Resilient Swarm Architecture & Anti-Drift SSoT

- **Swarm Fleet Operations:** Introduced Task-Isolated AI Branching (TIA-Branching) for parallel agent work.
- **Git Swarm Manager:** New `bootstrap/git-swarm-manager.sh` for collision-free commits and automated push/squash.
- **Anti-Drift SSoT:** Enforced `TEMPLATE/_system/` as the single source of truth; banned global IDE mutations.
- **Agent Hook Parity:** Unified adapters for Cursor, Windsurf, Claude/Cline, Continue, and Copilot.

## 1.19.6 (2026-04-05)

### Changed
- `GIT_REMOTE_AND_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md` — **Non-negotiable priority**: Git sync treated as blocking work; session start `git fetch`, end-of-session commit + push; `.git` ownership repair; hooks / `--no-verify` policy.
- `AGENTS.md` (installable + master root) — explicit **Git and remotes** section; master repo commit/push and `whyte`-only expectations.

### Meta (master repo only)
- `context/OWNER_GIT_REMOTES.md` — agent expectations: Git tasks non-negotiable when work should survive.

## 1.19.5 - 2026-04-05

### Added
- `_system/GIT_REMOTE_AND_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md` — GitHub remotes, **SSH** transport, fetch/pull/push sync discipline, empty-remote bootstrap, auth failure handling; SavigeSystemZ operator profile (`SavageO13` / `SavigeSystemZ`, Michael Spaulding, `mtspaulding87@gmail.com`); **run Git and SSH as UNIX user `whyte`, not `root`** (keys and agent are user-scoped).

### Changed

- `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` — discovery entry for the Git remote and sync protocol.
- `bootstrap/check-network-bindings.sh` — skip `.mypy_cache` / `.ruff_cache` / `.pytest_cache` and vendored `_AI_AGENT_SYSTEM/` when scanning for wildcard binds (reduces false positives in real app trees).

### Meta (master repo only)
- `context/OWNER_GIT_REMOTES.md` — maintainer-only mirror of org layout, identity, and **`whyte`-only Git/SSH** rule.
- `KEY.md`, `META_SYSTEM_INTERCONNECT_INDEX.md`, `WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md`, `context/CURRENT_STATUS.md` — continuity and cross-links.

## 1.19.4 - 2026-04-05

## 1.19.1 - 2026-04-05

### Added
- `_system/SUB_AGENT_HOST_DELEGATION.md` — optional parallel host CLI / auxiliary sessions (honest limits: no auto-spawn MCP), primary takeover on failure
- `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/DEFERRED_USER_REMINDERS.md` — maintainer-only deferred follow-ups the user asked to surface after ~two future prompts

### Changed
- `CROSS_PLATFORM_DISTRIBUTION_AND_INSTALLER_STANDARD.md` — **minimum launch milestone**: scaffold installers/distribution once the app is first launchable for host dogfooding

### Added — Cross-platform distribution and Composer overlays
- `_system/CROSS_PLATFORM_DISTRIBUTION_AND_INSTALLER_STANDARD.md` — shipped-app installer contract (multi-OS layout, operator menu, port governance, hardening expectations) distinct from AIAST lifecycle `INSTALLER_AND_UPGRADE_CONTRACT.md`
- `bootstrap/templates/runtime/distribution/**` — generated `distribution/` tree with `platforms/linux|windows|macos|android|ios` READMEs and a Windows `Install.ps1` scaffold
- `.cursor/rules/60-composer-orchestration.mdc`, `.cursor/commands/composer-session.md`, `.cursor/agents/composer-lead.md` — Composer-oriented orchestration overlays

### Changed
- `_system/CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, `_system/LOAD_ORDER.md`, `_system/PROMPT_SYSTEM_BUILD_STANDARD.md`, `_system/prompt-packs/M6_INSTALL_AND_DISTRIBUTION.md`, and `bootstrap/check-runtime-foundations.sh` now reference `distribution/` and the new standard
- `bootstrap/validate-system.sh` requires the new runtime template paths

### Meta (master repo only)
- `_META_AGENT_SYSTEM/META_SYSTEM_INTERCONNECT_INDEX.md` — maintainer layer awareness graph and refresh rules

## 1.17.0 - 2026-04-03

### Added — Installer Integrity and Smart Scaffold Entry
- `bootstrap/scaffold-system.sh` — unified smart entrypoint that auto-detects target state and routes to first install, additive backfill, or update flow.
- `_system/INSTALLER_AND_UPGRADE_CONTRACT.md` — explicit contract for install, update, repair, and heal behavior plus state-preservation guarantees.

### Changed — Bootstrap UX and Drift Resistance
- `init-project.sh`, `install-missing-files.sh`, and `wizard.sh` now prompt for target path when run interactively without arguments.
- `validate-system.sh`, `check-system-awareness.sh`, and `validate-instruction-layer.sh` now enforce the installer contract and smart scaffold surfaces.
- `bootstrap/README.md`, `_system/QUICKSTART.md`, `_system/LOAD_ORDER.md`, `_system/CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, and `_system/UPGRADE_AND_DRIFT_POLICY.md` now cross-link installer behavior and customization flow.

### Changed — Neutrality and Product-Safe Guidance
- `_system/CURSOR_AND_MULTI_HOST.md` now uses generic multi-repo examples instead of environment-specific names.
- `_system/SECURITY_HARDENING_CONTRACT.md` privilege-separation example is now app-neutral.
- `_system/PROJECT_PROFILE.md` now includes post-scaffold customization instructions for app-specific truth.

### Fixed — Factory Lane Reliability
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/GOLDEN_EXAMPLES/REVIEW_NOTES.md` now includes required review sections for all high-scoring non-selected repos.
- `validate-system.sh` absolute-path leak detection now excludes `.git` internals to avoid false positives in strict update smoke.
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-live-host-clis.sh` treats Cursor root-only `--no-sandbox` refusal as a soft-skip condition.

## 1.16.0 - 2026-03-28

### Added — Gemini "Infinite" Context (Tier S) and Whole-Repo Analysis
- `_system/prompt-packs/M15_WHOLE_REPO_ANALYSIS.md` — new prompt pack for Tier S agents (1M+ tokens) focused on deep architectural reviews, system-wide consistency audits, and comprehensive impact analysis
- `Tier S: Infinite (1M+ tokens)` added to `CONTEXT_BUDGET_STRATEGY.md` and `agent-performance-profiles.json`, elevating Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash to this elite context tier

### Changed — Agent Capability and Execution Guidance
- `AGENT_PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md` now includes Tier S and whole-repo analysis as a primary task-to-model mapping
- `AGENT_DISCOVERY_MATRIX.md` updated to reflect Gemini's best use as a whole-repo synthesizer and architectural auditor
- `EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md` now carries explicit guidance for Tier S agents, including cross-referencing runtime code against the entire `_system/` layer to detect drift and using multimodal inputs for UI/UX fidelity

## 1.15.0 - 2026-03-28

### Added — Handoff Governance and Evidence Validation
- `_system/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` — formalized quality requirements for
  agent-to-agent handoffs with required fields, evidence standard, and
  anti-pattern guidance
- `bootstrap/check-evidence-quality.sh` — scans WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md,
  CURRENT_STATUS.md, and RELEASE_NOTES.md for ungrounded claims (e.g.,
  "all tests pass" without command evidence)
- `bootstrap/check-working-file-staleness.sh` — detects stale handoff
  and planning files by comparing git timestamps, embedded dates, and
  cross-checking WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md phase against PLAN.md objective
- `bootstrap/check-bootstrap-permissions.sh` — validates all bootstrap/*.sh
  scripts are executable, with `--fix` mode for automatic repair

### Changed — Enhanced Working File Templates
- `WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md` template now includes required-field guidance,
  concrete good/bad examples, and references to the handoff protocol
  and evidence quality checker
- `TODO.md` template now includes priority signals (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  with definitions and a Completed section for session-end tracking
- `EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md` Stage 5 now references HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md and
  the evidence quality checker
- `VALIDATION_GATES.md` evidence standard now references the handoff protocol
  and both new validation scripts
- `HALLUCINATION_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL.md` now lists the evidence quality and
  staleness detection commands
- `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` now lists the handoff protocol and all 3 new scripts
- `LOAD_ORDER.md` Tier 2 now includes HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md; Tier 3 now
  includes the 3 new bootstrap scripts

### Changed — System Doctor Expansion
- `system-doctor.sh` now runs 16 checks (was 13), integrating
  check-bootstrap-permissions, check-evidence-quality, and
  check-working-file-staleness as warning-level checks

### Fixed — Bootstrap Script Permissions
- Added missing execute permission on 3 scripts: apply-starter-blueprint.sh,
  check-host-bundle.sh, emit-host-bundle.sh (discovered by the new
  permissions checker)

## 1.14.0 - 2026-03-27

### Added — Cross-Agent Adapter Expansion (M1)
- 6 new agent adapters: DEEPSEEK.md, .aider.conf.yml, .continuerules, .clinerules, PEARAI.md, LOCAL_MODELS.md
- `render_aider()` function in generate-host-adapters.sh for YAML adapter output
- Updated AGENT_DISCOVERY_MATRIX.md and MULTI_AGENT_COORDINATION.md with all new agents

## 1.13.7 - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- the Flutter Android blueprint guidance now explicitly tells agents to run
  `flutter create --platforms=android .` around the copied minimal foundation
  before expecting Flutter analyze, test, or APK build commands to work
- the shipped mobile runtime READMEs and mobile guide now say the same thing in
  installable repo-local terms, so downstream agents no longer have to infer
  the missing Flutter/Gradle project-generation step from a sparse scaffold
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-test-app-campaign.sh` now includes the mobile repo in
  its wrapper proof and asserts that the copied mobile README and blueprint both
  carry the downstream-proven bootstrap step

## 1.13.6 - 2026-03-25

### Changed

- `bootstrap/validate-system.sh` now also checks
  `_system/instruction-precedence.json.template_version` so stale precedence
  manifests cannot silently drift from the rest of the version surfaces
- the FastAPI and Python CLI starter-blueprint guidance now tells agents to use
  a `src/` layout or explicit package discovery in `pyproject.toml` inside
  scaffolded AIAST repos instead of relying on flat setuptools auto-discovery

## 1.13.5 - 2026-03-25

### Added

- `bootstrap/generate-system-key.sh` so installed repos can regenerate an
  exhaustive agent-facing key for the full AIAST-managed file set
- `_system/KEY.md` as the installable exhaustive file-by-file map of the AIAST
  surface, including what each file is for and when it should be used

### Changed

- installable startup and discovery docs now point agents at `_system/KEY.md`
  when they need full coverage instead of a shorter index view
- strict validation and source-template automation now treat the generated key
  as a first-class required surface alongside the registry and operating
  profile

### Fixed

- `bootstrap/generate-system-key.sh` now resolves relative target paths
  correctly so `bootstrap/generate-system-key.sh . --write` writes to the real
  repo instead of nesting an extra relative path under the target root

## 1.13.4 - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- the shipped Flatpak manifest templates now use the repo root as their source
  dir when the manifest lives under `packaging/`, so real `flatpak-builder`
  runs can see repo-root artifacts like `dist/<app>` instead of failing during
  install
- packaging docs now state that the Flatpak source dir must stay rooted at
  `..` for repo-root build outputs to remain visible during packaging
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-packaging-builders.sh` is now a real host-validated
  gate because the required Flatpak runtime is installed locally and the shipped
  manifest no longer points at the wrong build context

## 1.13.3 - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- `bootstrap/update-template.sh` now always refreshes the installed version and contract-manifest surfaces that generated upgrade metadata depends on, and lifecycle metadata now stores a neutral template-source label instead of a machine-local absolute path, so additive upgrades stop reporting stale versions without leaking maintainer paths into installed repos
- strict template updates now validate against the canonical source-template validator chain instead of trusting drifted target-side validator copies, so preserved older validation scripts can no longer mask an invalid instruction layer during upgrade
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh` now exercises an upgrade regression where a downstream repo keeps stale target validators and an outdated `AGENTS.md`, proving that additive upgrades warn truthfully and strict upgrades fail until the instruction layer is brought back into contract

## 1.13.2 - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- `bootstrap/recommend-starter-blueprint.sh` now matches blueprint keywords with boundary-aware terms so generic product language like `client` no longer leaks into CLI recommendations and incidental `desktop` references do not create false desktop bias
- the starter-blueprint recommender now gives stronger weight to truthfully filled greenfield profile signals such as Flutter frameworks, mobile runtime roots, and Flutter validation commands, so a concrete Android-client repo can move from manual review to an actual `FLUTTER_ANDROID_CLIENT` recommendation before runtime code is deeply built out
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-blueprint-recommendation.sh` now proves that a mobile-first greenfield repo with a filled Android/Flutter profile selects `FLUTTER_ANDROID_CLIENT` while blank installs still avoid false positives

## 1.13.1 - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- `bootstrap/check-placeholders.sh` now ignores `## Entry format` and `## Entry template` sections so installed repos are flagged for real onboarding blanks instead of schema/example lines in working and context files
- installable bootstrap docs now describe the placeholder check in the same actionable, section-aware terms as the shipped behavior
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-blueprint-application.sh` now proves that placeholder checks still catch real `PROJECT_PROFILE.md` blanks while ignoring schema-only sections in files like `FIXME.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md`, context entry logs, and the MCP catalog

## 1.13.0 - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- `bootstrap/apply-starter-blueprint.sh` now adds a blueprint-specific risk entry to `RISK_REGISTER.md` when the repo is still carrying seeded onboarding-risk content, so explicit build-shape confirmation also sharpens the early risk picture
- explicit blueprint application now reports `RISK_REGISTER.md` in its generated handoff scope and files-changed surface so the continuity packet matches the real projected file set
- installable docs and clean-room blueprint smoke now treat risk framing as part of the explicit blueprint-projection review surface alongside product, plan, validation, design, architecture, release, and handoff state

## 1.12.0 - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- `bootstrap/apply-starter-blueprint.sh` now also projects an explicitly selected blueprint into `DESIGN_NOTES.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` when those files are present, and its generated handoff text now reports that broader surface set truthfully
- installable bootstrap and working-file docs now treat design and release framing as part of the explicit blueprint-projection review surface instead of leaving those files implied or manual after build-shape confirmation
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-blueprint-application.sh` now proves that explicit blueprint application reaches design and release framing in addition to the earlier product, plan, validation, queue, handoff, and architecture surfaces

## 1.11.0 - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- `bootstrap/apply-starter-blueprint.sh` now projects an explicitly selected blueprint into additional repo-local operating surfaces, including `TEST_STRATEGY.md`, `TODO.md`, `WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md` when present
- the greenfield documentation flow now tells agents to persist a recommendation first and then explicitly apply the blueprint instead of treating blueprint application as a standalone manual list-and-pick step
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-blueprint-application.sh` now proves that the richer blueprint projection reaches the first validation, handoff, architecture, and queue surfaces coherently

## 1.10.0 - 2026-03-23

### Added

- `_system/AGENT_ROLE_CATALOG.md` as the canonical role and write-scope contract for multi-agent work
- `bootstrap/recommend-starter-blueprint.sh` to persist advisory blueprint recommendations with confidence and rationale
- `bootstrap/check-agent-orchestration.sh` to verify role-catalog, prompt-pack, and Cursor role-overlay alignment
- new Cursor execution-role overlays for orchestration, implementation, validation, and continuity
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-blueprint-recommendation.sh` to prove fresh installs avoid false blueprint picks while real runtime or product signals still recommend coherently

### Changed

- startup, discovery, prompt-pack, and multi-agent docs now load and reference the shared role catalog instead of leaving delegation behavior implicit
- fresh install, additive install, and update now persist a starter-blueprint recommendation after product-brief seeding while keeping blueprint application explicit
- the deterministic validation chain now includes orchestration-alignment checks plus blueprint recommendation smoke
- `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` now stores recommended blueprint, confidence, and rationale alongside the explicitly selected blueprint

### Fixed

- closed a greenfield bootstrap risk where generated runtime scaffolds could bias a naive blueprint recommender toward the wrong app shape

## 1.9.0 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` as a first-class repo-local product framing surface
- `bootstrap/seed-product-brief.sh` to turn profile signals into a bounded first-pass `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`
- `bootstrap/apply-starter-blueprint.sh` to stamp a selected starter blueprint into the first repo-local operating surfaces
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-blueprint-application.sh` to prove a clean-room repo can apply a blueprint coherently

### Changed

- Fresh install, additive install, and update now seed `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` through the shared onboarding refresh path instead of leaving product framing manual
- Agent startup docs, host-adapter startup manifests, and working-file guidance now treat `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` as part of the canonical greenfield shaping surface
- Install metadata now retains the repo app identity so lifecycle recovery can preserve the intended app name even when early working files are temporarily missing
- The deterministic factory proof chain now includes starter-blueprint application smoke alongside installed-repo and packaging smokes

### Fixed

- Closed a greenfield bootstrap gap where starter blueprints existed as reference docs but did not yet project themselves into repo-local execution and product-planning surfaces

## 1.8.3 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- `bootstrap/seed-risk-register.sh` to turn inferred profile and confidence signals into a bounded first-pass `RISK_REGISTER.md`

### Changed

- Fresh install, additive install, and update now seed `RISK_REGISTER.md` through the shared onboarding refresh path instead of leaving repo-local risk tracking fully manual during onboarding
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-installed-repo.sh` now proves deleted `RISK_REGISTER.md` is restored and seeded during additive recovery

### Fixed

- Closed an onboarding gap where validation strategy could be seeded but the adjacent risk surface still started from a neutral blank in installed repos

## 1.8.2 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- `bootstrap/seed-test-strategy.sh` to convert inferred validation commands in `_system/PROJECT_PROFILE.md` into a first-pass `TEST_STRATEGY.md`

### Changed

- Fresh install, additive install, and update now seed `TEST_STRATEGY.md` through the shared onboarding refresh path instead of leaving validation strategy fully manual after profile inference
- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-installed-repo.sh` now proves deleted `TEST_STRATEGY.md` is restored and seeded during additive recovery

### Fixed

- Closed an onboarding gap where inferred validation commands existed in the project profile but the repo-local confidence model still started blank after install or recovery

## 1.8.1 - 2026-03-22

### Changed

- `bootstrap/init-project.sh`, `bootstrap/install-missing-files.sh`, and `bootstrap/update-template.sh` now share one safe onboarding refresh path after copy operations
- Additive installs and upgrades now re-run non-destructive runtime-foundation generation, profile inference, working-state seeding, and validation-state recording instead of only copying template files

### Fixed

- Closed a lifecycle recovery gap where restored or newly added AIAST files could come back without regenerated app-owned runtime scaffolds or reseeded continuity surfaces

## 1.8.0 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Opportunistic live external-host CLI smoke via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-live-host-clis.sh`

### Changed

- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-automation-lane.sh` now includes optional live external-host proof in addition to optional builder smoke
- The portable baseline is now backed by real live-host transcripts on supported authenticated headless CLIs instead of only the fixture and host-bundle simulation layers

### Fixed

- Closed the live external-host transcript gap by proving the exported host-bundle flow against actual installed Codex and Cursor host CLIs on this machine

## 1.7.2 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Factory-side golden-example promotion criteria via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/GOLDEN_EXAMPLES/PROMOTION_CRITERIA.md` and `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/GOLDEN_EXAMPLES/promotion-rubric.json`
- Deterministic donor-governance validation via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-golden-examples.sh`

### Changed

- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh` now proves golden-example selection governance after scorecard refresh instead of relying on review discipline alone
- Factory donor selection now has explicit measurable thresholds plus a required review path for high-scoring non-selected repos

### Fixed

- Closed a governance gap where donor promotion quality depended too heavily on remembered reviewer intent even though scorecards and review notes already existed

## 1.7.1 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Generated Cursor session-start and canonical context-rule overlays via `.cursor/commands/session-start.md` and `.cursor/rules/00-context-load.mdc`

### Changed

- `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json`, `bootstrap/generate-host-adapters.sh`, and `_system/HOST_ADAPTER_POLICY.md` now treat the remaining thin Cursor startup overlays as part of the managed adapter set
- The generated adapter boundary is now explicit: stable startup and context-load overlays are generated, while richer review commands, skills, and agent-specific workflows remain hand-authored until real drift justifies expansion

### Fixed

- Closed the last obvious Cursor startup drift seam by moving session-start and always-apply context-load guidance under the same canonical manifest as the other tool-entry surfaces

## 1.7.0 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Canonical external host-bundle contract via `_system/HOST_BUNDLE_CONTRACT.md`
- Self-contained host-bundle emission via `bootstrap/emit-host-bundle.sh`
- Host-bundle validation via `bootstrap/check-host-bundle.sh`
- Separate-workspace external host-bundle smoke via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-host-bundle.sh`

### Changed

- The operating profile, capabilities markers, instruction-layer validation, system doctor, and factory proof chain now include host-bundle export surfaces
- External host support now has a vendor-neutral zero-repo-access path instead of relying only on live repo-path access or the earlier bounded fixture

### Fixed

- Closed a real external-ingestion gap where the system could prove a host fixture consuming repo paths but could not yet export a deterministic self-contained prompt-and-context snapshot for hosts without repo access

## 1.6.0 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Canonical host-adapter governance via `_system/HOST_ADAPTER_POLICY.md` and `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json`
- Generated tool-adapter and load-context surfaces via `bootstrap/generate-host-adapters.sh`
- Adapter-alignment validation via `bootstrap/check-host-adapter-alignment.sh`

### Changed

- `CODEX.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `WINDSURF.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/commands/load-context.md`, and `.cursor/skills/load-context/SKILL.md` now come from the canonical host-adapter manifest instead of drifting independently
- Managed write flows now refresh generated host adapters before registry, operating-profile, and integrity regeneration
- The instruction-layer and doctor flows now validate adapter alignment as part of normal proof instead of treating tool-entry files as static prose

### Fixed

- Closed a real adapter drift gap where Cursor load-context surfaces had fallen behind the canonical precedence and operating-profile startup order

## 1.5.1 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Factory automation entrypoint via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/run-automation-lane.sh` plus scheduled CI automation in `.github/workflows/validate-master-template.yml`
- Factory host-adapter fixture smoke via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-host-adapter-fixture.sh`
- Optional Flatpak-first builder-aware packaging smoke via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-packaging-builders.sh`

### Changed

- `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/validate-master-template.sh` now includes host-adapter fixture proof in the deterministic master validation chain
- The preferred automation path is now one shared local-and-CI lane instead of relying on remembered manual release choreography
- External integration follow-up is now split cleanly between deterministic fixture proof and opportunistic real-builder proof

## 1.5.0 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Dedicated packaging-target validation via `bootstrap/check-packaging-targets.sh` and clean-room packaging smoke via `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/smoke-packaging-targets.sh`
- Canonical host-prompt emission via `bootstrap/emit-host-prompt.sh` plus repo-side host-ingestion validation via `bootstrap/check-host-ingestion.sh`
- Shared generated Linux desktop launcher metadata for packaging targets, including placeholder-rendered runtime template paths

### Changed

- `validate-instruction-layer.sh`, `system-doctor.sh`, and `validate-master-template.sh` now include host-ingestion and packaging-target proof instead of relying only on runtime-foundation smoke
- Runtime foundations now render placeholders in file paths as well as file contents, so generated assets can carry app-specific filenames safely
- AppImage and Flatpak scaffolds now share a generated desktop launcher file instead of duplicating launcher metadata in incompatible ways

### Fixed

- Closed a real packaging contract gap where Flatpak referenced a desktop launcher file that the runtime scaffold did not actually generate

## 1.4.1 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Template-aware repo-mode detection for `validate-system.sh`, `check-placeholders.sh`, and `system-doctor.sh`
- Factory smoke coverage for clean-room installed repos and live runtime foundations, plus `validate-master-template.sh` as the one-command master proof chain
- Factory review notes for high-scoring donor candidates so golden-example promotion decisions survive context resets

### Changed

- The neutral source template now validates cleanly in auto/template mode while installed repos still treat unresolved repo-owned placeholders as failures
- Runtime-foundation validation now includes shell-sourceability checks for generated env defaults and executable smoke for install, repair, launch, and purge flows
- Golden-example donor curation now records explicit review outcomes for high-scoring candidates instead of leaving their deferral implicit

### Fixed

- Generated runtime env defaults with multi-word shell values are now quoted so installed launch flows can source them safely

## 1.4.0 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Neutral golden-example system under `_system/golden-examples/` with policy, pattern guides, and exemplar working files
- Factory-only donor scoring and selection assets under `_TEMPLATE_FACTORY/GOLDEN_EXAMPLES/`
- `refresh-golden-examples.sh` to rescan sibling repos and rebuild the donor scorecard

### Changed

- Agent adapters, load-order docs, discovery docs, and bootstrap docs now point to the golden-example pack for system-evolution and working-file-authoring tasks
- Operating-profile generation, awareness checks, and system validation now treat the golden-example pack as a first-class managed surface
- Factory maintenance now tracks donor selection explicitly instead of relying on remembered chat context

## 1.3.0 - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Repo-local instruction precedence contract and machine-readable precedence manifest
- Conflict detection, operating-profile generation, and instruction-layer validation scripts
- Host-safe prompt emission contract plus compatibility markers for upstream ingestion

### Changed

- Core adapters and load-order docs now point to the precedence contract and operating profile
- Validation and doctor flows now verify instruction-layer integrity
- Upgrade, install-missing, and heal flows now refresh the operating profile alongside the registry
- Runtime-foundation defaults are template-neutral instead of carrying branded placeholder values

## 1.2.0 - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Runtime-foundation validation via `bootstrap/check-runtime-foundations.sh`
- Starter blueprints for Flutter Android clients and universal multi-surface app platforms
- Runtime scaffold checks for install scripts, env defaults, AI config, mobile manifest, and packaging manifests

### Changed

- `system-doctor.sh` now inspects generated runtime foundations in addition to system integrity
- Bootstrap and context docs now expose the new runtime checker and expanded blueprint layer

## 1.1.0 - 2026-03-20

### Added

- Runtime foundation generator for packaging, install, mobile, logging, and AI scaffolds
- Installation, packaging, mobile, and chatbot guides plus provider-config example
- Flutter-first Android starter files and packaging/signing templates
- Linux packaging manifests for AppImage, Flatpak, and Snap in generated repos
- CI examples for packaging and Android build surfaces

### Changed

- `init-project.sh` now generates project-owned runtime foundations automatically
- Project profile defaults now stamp app ids, installer paths, mobile paths, and branch-strategy guidance
- Security and observability guidance now cover installer separation, service accounts, JSON logging fields, and `logcat`

## 1.0.0 - 2026-03-19

### Added

- First-class AIAST version metadata and installed-repo metadata
- Upgrade and uninstall lifecycle scripts
- Integrity-aware drift detection and manifest policy
- Expanded project profile schema and broader repo detection
- Security scan and hardened systemd unit generation tooling
- CI, packaging, observability, and plugin-contract scaffolds

### Changed

- Bootstrap lifecycle now records install source, timestamps, and README placement
- Drift and upgrade policy now use explicit template version markers instead of commit-message convention
- Integrity manifests exclude app-owned state and project-local config surfaces
tegrity manifests exclude app-owned state and project-local config surfaces
