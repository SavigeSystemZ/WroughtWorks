# Host Adapter Policy

This policy governs the tool-specific adapter files that sit on top of the shared repo-local AIAST core.

## Cross-agent universality (binding)

Every capability in this repo — rules, skills, commands, policies, hooks,
modes, fleet/sub-agent roles, abilities, and instructions — is
**authoritative for every agent**, primarily but not limited to: Claude,
Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, Copilot, Aider, Cline, Continue, DeepSeek,
PearAI, Grok, and local models.

- A capability living under a host-specific namespace (`.cursor/`,
  `.claude/`, `.windsurf/`, `.github/`, etc.) is a **delivery mechanism for
  that host, not a scope limit.** The underlying definition is plain,
  agent-neutral markdown/JSON and applies to all agents.
- Any agent whose host lacks native support for a mechanism MUST still
  honor it by reading the underlying file: treat
  `.cursor/skills/<x>/SKILL.md`, `.cursor/commands/<x>.md`, rules, hooks,
  and modes as instructions to follow, regardless of which tool's folder
  they sit in.
- The universal entry path is `AGENTS.md` → `_system/` canonical load
  order (`CONTEXT_INDEX.md`, `LOAD_ORDER.md`, `READ_BUNDLES.md`). Every
  host adapter delegates here; nothing agent-facing may be reachable by
  only one agent.
- When adding a capability, register it on the universal surface first;
  host-native generation (where supported) is additive, never a gate on
  which agents may use it.

## Purpose

- Keep all supported tool entry files aligned with `AGENTS.md`, `_system/INSTRUCTION_PRECEDENCE_CONTRACT.md`, and `_system/REPO_OPERATING_PROFILE.md`.
- Treat tool adapters as live host-consumption surfaces, not freehand prose islands.
- Reduce adapter drift by generating the highest-risk shared adapter files from one manifest instead of rewriting them independently.

## Canonical sources

- `AGENTS.md`
- `_system/INSTRUCTION_PRECEDENCE_CONTRACT.md`
- `_system/REPO_OPERATING_PROFILE.md`
- `_system/LOAD_ORDER.md`
- `_system/PROMPT_EMISSION_CONTRACT.md`
- `_system/AGENT_SURFACE_TAXONOMY.md`
- `_system/AGENT_INIT_CONVERGENCE.md`
- `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json`

## Generated adapter surfaces

The following files are generated from `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json`:

- `CODEX.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `GEMINI.md`
- `WINDSURF.md`
- `ANTIGRAVITY.md`
- `.cursorrules`
- `.windsurfrules`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.cursor/commands/load-context.md`
- `.cursor/commands/session-start.md`
- `.cursor/skills/load-context/SKILL.md`
- `.cursor/rules/00-context-load.mdc`

## Compatibility placeholder surfaces

The following top-level files are intentionally lightweight compatibility placeholders and are validated for presence:

- `CURSOR.md`
- `COPILOT.md`
- `AIDER.md`
- `AGENT_ZERO.md`

They must point to shared contracts and must not duplicate or override policy.

## Change rules

- Do not hand-edit generated adapter surfaces as the primary maintenance path.
- If the shared startup contract changes, update the canonical source docs and `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json`, then run `bootstrap/generate-host-adapters.sh <repo> --write`.
- Validate generated adapter alignment with `bootstrap/aiast-cli check-alignment <repo>`.
- Run `bootstrap/validate-instruction-layer.sh <repo>` after changing adapter-generation logic, the manifest, or the shared precedence/emission contracts.

## Boundary rules

- Adapters may add tool-specific emphasis, but they must not override repo-local truth.
- Adapters and generated command surfaces must preserve workspace authority rules:
  project-local copies are authoritative; parent/global files are redirect shims only.
- Adapters must keep runtime code independent from `_system/`.
- Adapters should point back to canonical repo files instead of duplicating long rule bodies.
- Prefer generation only for stable startup, context-load, and authority overlays. Keep richer review commands, broader skills, and agent-specific workflow docs hand-authored unless real drift proves they need the same treatment.
- If a tool needs a different startup shape, add that variation to the manifest or generator instead of introducing unmanaged divergence.

## Maintenance path

1. Update shared source docs or `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json`.
2. Run `bootstrap/generate-host-adapters.sh <repo> --write`.
3. Run `bootstrap/aiast-cli check-alignment <repo>`.
4. Run `bootstrap/validate-instruction-layer.sh <repo>`.
5. Regenerate system metadata if the repo is in a managed write flow.

## Deprecation lifecycle

- `deprecated_aliases` in `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json` supports lifecycle metadata:
  - `target`
  - `deprecated_since`
  - `remove_after`
  - `migration_doc`
- Validators fail when an alias passes `remove_after` for the current template version.
- Alias removals must update migration and release docs in the same change set.
