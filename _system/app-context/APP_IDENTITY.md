# App Identity
Status: DEFINED.
This file is intentionally app-neutral in the parent AIAST template.
After scaffold into a project-specific repo, replace the sections below
with project-specific truth. Do not copy facts from other apps. Do not
leave this file blank after the first meaningful project setup pass. Do
not write secrets here.

## What this file is

App-specific context for this app's identity — a universal app-context file every
AIAST app fills. Project-specific truth, derived from `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`
and `app/`.

## Fill this in

- The app name and its one-line purpose.
- The primary users and the core job they hire this app to do.
- The selected primary archetype id (see APP_ARCHETYPE_ROUTING_MATRIX.md) and any secondary constraints.
- What success looks like for the first release.

## Evidence that belongs here

Concrete, checkable facts — not aspirations. Never secrets, tokens, or
credentials.
