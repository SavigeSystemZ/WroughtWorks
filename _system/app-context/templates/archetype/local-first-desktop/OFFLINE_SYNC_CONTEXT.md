# Offline Sync Context
Status: DEFINED.
This file is intentionally app-neutral in the parent AIAST template.
After scaffold into a project-specific repo, replace the sections below
with project-specific truth. Do not copy facts from other apps. Do not
leave this file blank after the first meaningful project setup pass. Do
not write secrets here.

## What this file is

App-specific context for offline and sync, part of the `local-first-desktop` archetype context pack
(`_system/archetypes/local-first-desktop.md`). Project-specific truth, derived from
`PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` and `app/`.

## Fill this in

- What works fully offline.
- The sync model and the conflict-resolution strategy.
- What triggers a sync.
- Failure and retry behavior when sync cannot complete.

## Evidence that belongs here

Concrete, checkable facts — not aspirations. Never secrets, tokens, or
credentials.
