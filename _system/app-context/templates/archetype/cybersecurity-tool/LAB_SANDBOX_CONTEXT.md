# Lab Sandbox Context
Status: DEFINED.
This file is intentionally app-neutral in the parent AIAST template.
After scaffold into a project-specific repo, replace the sections below
with project-specific truth. Do not copy facts from other apps. Do not
leave this file blank after the first meaningful project setup pass. Do
not write secrets here.

## What this file is

App-specific context for the lab and sandbox, part of the `cybersecurity-tool` archetype context pack
(`_system/archetypes/cybersecurity-tool.md`). Project-specific truth, derived from
`PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` and `app/`.

## Fill this in

- The isolated environment the tool runs against.
- The network containment in effect.
- How the lab is reset between runs.
- What must never leave the lab.

## Evidence that belongs here

Concrete, checkable facts — not aspirations. Never secrets, tokens, or
credentials.
