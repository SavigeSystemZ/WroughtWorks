# CLI Distribution Context
Status: DEFINED.
This file is intentionally app-neutral in the parent AIAST template.
After scaffold into a project-specific repo, replace the sections below
with project-specific truth. Do not copy facts from other apps. Do not
leave this file blank after the first meaningful project setup pass. Do
not write secrets here.

## What this file is

App-specific context for CLI distribution, part of the `cli-tool` archetype context pack
(`_system/archetypes/cli-tool.md`). Project-specific truth, derived from
`PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` and `app/`.

## Fill this in

- The distribution channels (package managers, prebuilt binaries).
- The supported platforms and architectures.
- Install, upgrade, and uninstall paths.
- Versioning and release cadence.

## Evidence that belongs here

Concrete, checkable facts — not aspirations. Never secrets, tokens, or
credentials.
