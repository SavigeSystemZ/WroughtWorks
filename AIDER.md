# AIDER.md

Use `AGENTS.md` as the shared contract for this repository.

For canonical authority and startup order, load:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `_system/INSTRUCTION_PRECEDENCE_CONTRACT.md`
3. `_system/REPO_OPERATING_PROFILE.md`
4. `_system/LOAD_ORDER.md`
5. `_system/AGENT_DISCOVERY_MATRIX.md`

Aider's generated adapter surface is `.aider.conf.yml`.

This file is a compatibility placeholder so cross-agent scaffolds can rely on a stable `AIDER.md` filename without duplicating policy.

Tool-memory writes go through `bootstrap/stamp-tool-memory.sh` per `_system/TOOL_MEMORY_ISOLATION_STAMP.md`.
